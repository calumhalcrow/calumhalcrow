Bio
---

![Calum Halcrow](/i/bio.jpg "That's me and my wife folks.")I was born and brought up in [Shetland](http://shetland.org), Scotland. After finishing school I went to study Mathematics at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk). After graduating I felt a change of direction was necessary and so [moved into web development](http://nbcommunication.com) and programming. I met my now wife during university and we decided to settle down in [Malaysia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia) where she's from. We currently live in the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur, and I currently work as a Perl programmer in Cyberjaya, a tech hub located just outside the city.

Projects
--------

Here's a run-down of some of the projects I'm currently involved in. The "Tech stack" underneath each lists major technologies used in each project, in particular the ones I am most familiar with.

### [BetOnMarkets.com](http://betonmarkets.com)

I have worked on BetOnMarkets, a provider of fixed-odd financial contracts, as an employee of Regent Markets (the site's owner) for six years. The service has a large user base, and working to maintain and bring it forward is a challenging role. I have learned a lot about the dynamics of a software company during my time there, from how to have the discipline to write high quality code when everyone wants things done yesterday, to the difficulties of managing a team of developers in a fast-paced company with (seemingly) tonnes of priorities. Definitely my pragmatism, attitude toward Getting Things Done, and general maturity as a software developer was carved into me at RMG (and still is being, to this day).

Tech stack: [Perl][1], [Moose][2], [Catalyst][3], [PostGreSQL][4], [CouchDB][5], [JavaScript][6], [JQuery][7], [Apache][8], [Nginx][9], [Jenkins][10], [Git][11], [Debian][12].

### [KudosEnglishLearning.com](http://kudosenglishlearning.com)

This is my wife's business website. She is an English Trainer, based in the Klang Valley area but often working across Peninsular Malaysia. The site from a technical point of view lacks bells and whistles, but I see that as a good thing. Easy to maintain, easy for visitors to find the information they're looking for, or get in touch. There are some subtle yet interesting design elements that can be found if you look for them: Web Fonts, CSS3 gradients and HTML5 mark-up. (Oh, and I designed the site myself; which I mention not so much as a complement to my design skills but more as an explanation as to why it looks as it does :-)

Tech stack: [WordPress][13], [DreamHost][14], [HTML5][15], [CSS3][16].

### [Campr](http://campr.herokuapp.com)

Campr is a webapp that facilitates networking at events. It allows you to see everyone who is at the event you are attending, along with a little bit of information about each person. Based on this, you can single out people you may want to get to know better. The project was started at [Hack Weekend](http://hack.weekend.my), a delightful hackathon series that takes place every quarter in Kuala Lumpur.

Tech stack: [Python][17], [Django][18], [Tornado][19], [SocketIO][20], [RabbitMQ][21], [SQLite][22], [Heroku][23].

### [WebCamp KL](http://webcamp.my)

WebCamp is a monthly meet-up of web professionals based in and around Kuala Lumpur. I am a fairly active member of the community, and have volunteered to help the group develop in 2012 (read: I haven't done anything to help them... _yet_).

### [CunningsburghHeritage.com](http://cunningsburghheritage.com)

A site that I set up some time ago for the Cunningsburgh History Group, a community-based organisation from the village where I grew up. I handed over content administration to the group themselves, so the site largely runs itself.

Tech stack: [MODX](http://modx.com), DreamHost.

Also, (just about) worth mentioning:

### This very site!

CalumHalcrow.com is a very simple static-HTML page built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and hosted on [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine).

I used this site to experiment with [Responsive Web Design](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) techniques. If you're reading this on a smart-phone you should be experiencing a design more tailored to your screen-width. If you're on a larger display and are interested to see how resposive design works, try resizing the browser window and note how the design changes as the width gets smaller...

My Setup
--------

I like to use simple and lightweight yet powerful development tools. The OS I use is [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) [Linux](http://gnu.org). I do almost everything on a [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/s/bash) shell, use [Vim](http://vim.org) (the last editor you'll ever use) for writing code and Git for source control.
